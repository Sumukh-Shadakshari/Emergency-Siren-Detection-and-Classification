In this study, we assembled a final dataset consisting of audio samples from various online resources, collected through internet sources, such as Kaggle and AudioSet offered by Google. The dataset comprises of six classes: traffic, ambulance, firetruck,  police, weather alert (or civil defense) siren and fire alarm, with each class containing a total of 200 audio data files, except for the police class, which has 227 samples. All audio files in the dataset are in the .wav format and have a duration of 3 seconds.

To develop effective machine learning models, we explored four different approaches: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 

The results are explained in detail in the report.
